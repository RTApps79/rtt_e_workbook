  "patientEducation": {
    "goalsDiscussed": "Adjuvant Whole Breast Radiation Therapy (WBRT) aims to reduce the risk of local recurrence after lumpectomy for early-stage breast cancer. This hypofractionated regimen delivers the radiation in fewer, larger doses over a shorter time period, which is proven to be as effective and safe as longer courses. The goal is to eradicate any microscopic cancer cells that might remain after surgery.",
    "sideEffectsReviewed": "Common & Expected: Skin reaction (dermatitis) in the treated breast and underarm area, progressing from pinkness/redness (erythema) to dryness (dry desquamation) and potentially peeling or moist areas (moist desquamation), especially in skin folds. Itching and tenderness are common. Fatigue (mild to moderate, can persist for weeks after treatment). Breast swelling/tenderness, breast heaviness. Potential long-term changes in breast appearance/texture (firmness, slight size change, darkening of skin). Rare: Rib pain/fracture (very low risk), pneumonitis (lung inflammation, very low risk due to heart/lung sparing), heart changes (extremely low risk with modern techniques for left-sided lesions, even lower for right-sided), arm swelling (lymphedema - very low risk with negative sentinel nodes).",
    "safetyConsiderations": "Critical: Importance of consistent daily setup and maintaining immobility during treatment to ensure precise radiation delivery. Strict skin care (gentle washing with mild soap, applying prescribed topical creams/ointments like Aquaphor or Mometasone liberally, avoiding harsh products, perfumes, deodorants in the treated area, avoiding sun exposure). Reporting any significant skin breakdown, severe pain, fever/chills (signs of infection), or new arm swelling promptly. Maintaining good hydration and nutrition.",
    "patientResponsibilities": "Attend all daily RT appointments (Monday-Friday). Perform skin care as instructed by therapists and nurses. Maintain good arm/shoulder range of motion exercises. Attend weekly On-Treatment Visits (OTVs) with physician and nurses. Report any new or worsening symptoms, especially skin reaction, fatigue, or breast pain. Initiate adjuvant endocrine therapy (e.g., Letrozole) as instructed by your medical oncologist/surgeon after RT completion.",
    "medicationCompliance": "Use prescribed topical creams (Mometasone) and bland moisturizers (Aquaphor) as directed for skin reaction. Take Acetaminophen or other OTC pain relievers as needed for discomfort. Adhere to the schedule for starting adjuvant endocrine therapy after RT, as this is crucial for long-term breast cancer control."
