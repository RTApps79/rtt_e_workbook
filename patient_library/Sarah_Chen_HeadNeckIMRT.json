  "patientEducation": {
    "goalsDiscussed": "Definitive radiation therapy with concurrent Cisplatin aims for curative treatment of HPV-positive tonsil cancer. Goals include tumor eradication, prevention of recurrence in the primary site and neck, and long-term disease control. Preservation of swallowing function and quality of life are also key aims.",
    "sideEffectsReviewed": "Common: Severe mucositis (oral and pharyngeal inflammation, pain, difficulty swallowing, requiring PEG tube for nutrition), skin reaction (erythema, dry/moist desquamation), fatigue (can be profound), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), odynophagia (painful swallowing), xerostomia (dry mouth, often long-term/permanent), dysgeusia (taste changes). Chemotherapy-related: Nausea/vomiting, myelosuppression (lowered blood counts leading to infection/anemia risk), kidney damage (rare with hydration), neuropathy (tingling/numbness - rare for this regimen but possible with Cisplatin), hearing loss (ototoxicity - monitored with audiograms). Long-term: Fibrosis (tissue hardening), lymphedema (swelling), dental issues, potential secondary cancers (very rare).",
    "safetyConsiderations": "Critical: Strict adherence to daily RT and concurrent Cisplatin schedule. Importance of daily oral hygiene to mitigate mucositis and prevent infection. Meticulous skin care (gentle cleansing, prescribed moisturizers/creams, avoid sun/harsh products). Monitoring for signs of infection (fever, chills, severe sore throat, redness/pus at PEG site) due to low blood counts – report immediately. Close pain management (scheduled pain medications as needed). Daily weight monitoring to ensure adequate hydration and nutrition via PEG. Regular communication of symptoms to the care team.",
    "patientResponsibilities": "Attend all daily RT appointments. Take all prescribed oral medications (anti-emetics, pain meds, Magic Mouthwash) as instructed. Administer PEG tube feeds and hydration as prescribed. Maintain excellent oral hygiene (frequent rinses). Perform skin care as directed. Attend weekly On-Treatment Visits (OTVs) with physician and nurses, and complete all scheduled lab draws (CBC, Creatinine). Report any new or worsening symptoms, especially concerning pain, infection, or swallowing difficulty.",
    "medicationCompliance": "Crucial to take anti-emetics prior to Cisplatin. Use Magic Mouthwash frequently (every 2-4 hours) to manage mucositis. Take pain medications proactively as pain increases. Ensure continuous hydration and nutrition via PEG tube as oral intake declines. Discuss any challenges with medication adherence or side effects with the care team promptly."
