Chemotherapy-related: Nausea/vomiting, myelosuppression (low blood counts increasing infection/anemia/bleeding risk), peripheral neuropathy (tingling/numbness in hands/feet), muscle/joint pain, hair thinning/loss. Long-term: Chronic dry cough, lung fibrosis (scarring, impacting breathing), chronic esophagitis/swallowing issues, fatigue, lymphedema (swelling in neck), hypothyroidism (requiring medication), dental issues (due to dry mouth), potential secondary cancers (rare).",

Strict adherence to daily RT and chemotherapy schedule. Immediate reporting of fever (>100.4°F), chills, severe cough/SOB, new significant pain, or worsening swallowing difficulty due to risk of infection or pneumonitis. Meticulous skin care (gentle cleansing, prescribed creams, avoid sun exposure, harsh chemicals/friction). Close pain management (scheduled pain medications as needed). Daily weight monitoring for hydration/nutrition status. Regular communication of symptoms to the care team.",

Take all prescribed oral medications (anti-emetics, cough meds, Esomeprazole, pain meds) as instructed. Maintain good nutrition and hydration (soft foods, liquid supplements). Report any new or worsening symptoms promptly. Continue smoking cessation efforts actively. Attend all follow-up appointments and undergo prescribed imaging/blood tests.",
    "medicationCompliance": "Crucial to take anti-nausea meds prior to chemotherapy. Use Esomeprazole daily and cough suppressants proactively as symptoms develop. Adhere to pain medication schedule as needed to maintain comfort. Discuss any challenges with medication adherence or side effects with the care team promptly. Understand that chemotherapy doses or schedules might be adjusted based on blood counts, which is normal management."
