    "goalsDiscussed": "Palliative treatment to relieve pain in the right thigh/hip, prevent a bone fracture, and improve mobility. The goal is to strengthen the bone and reduce tumor growth in the treated area.",
    "sideEffectsReviewed": "Low risk of acute side effects: mild fatigue and a mild skin reaction (like a sunburn) in the treated area. A temporary 'pain flare' (worsening of pain) is possible in the first few days of radiation, managed with medication. Very low risk of deep tissue damage to surrounding muscles or nerves with this technique. Long-term risks include potential for chronic pain or ongoing fracture risk.",
    "safetyConsiderations": "Crucial importance of **strict adherence to 'protected weight bearing'** as instructed by the orthopedic doctor (using a walker or crutches, avoiding full weight on the treated leg) to prevent a pathologic fracture. Report any sudden increase in pain, new weakness, or inability to bear weight immediately. Maintaining good hydration and nutrition. Continue all systemic therapies as prescribed.",
    "patientResponsibilities": "Attend all daily RT for one week. Report any sudden increase in pain or new symptoms immediately. Strictly adhere to protected weight-bearing restrictions. Continue pain medication and endocrine therapy as prescribed. Perform recommended physical therapy exercises if provided.",
    "medicationCompliance": "Continue pain medication as needed and discuss tapering with primary oncology team as pain improves. Adhere to protected weight-bearing status. Continue ongoing endocrine therapy (Letrozole) as prescribed by Medical Oncology."
