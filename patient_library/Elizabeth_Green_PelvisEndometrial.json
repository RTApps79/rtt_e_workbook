    "goalsDiscussed": "Adjuvant pelvic radiation therapy (EBRT + vaginal brachytherapy) for FIGO Stage II endometrial adenocarcinoma. This combined approach targets the regional lymph nodes and the vaginal cuff, which are sites of higher recurrence risk for this stage and pathology. The goal is to reduce locoregional recurrence and improve long-term disease control after surgery.",
    "sideEffectsReviewed": "Acute (during EBRT): Fatigue (common), gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal cramping, rectal urgency/pain, nausea), genitourinary (GU) symptoms (increased urinary frequency/urgency, dysuria). Skin irritation (redness, dryness, itching) in groin/perineum. Acute (during Brachytherapy): Mild discomfort from applicator, vaginal fullness/pressure, mild rectal urgency. Late (months-years post-RT): Chronic changes to bowel/bladder habits (e.g., increased frequency, urgency), vaginal dryness, shortening, and stenosis (narrowing). Low risk of pelvic fracture. Extremely low risk of secondary malignancy.",
    "safetyConsiderations": "Critical: **Daily strict adherence to bowel/bladder preparation protocol** (full bladder, empty rectum) is paramount for ensuring accurate dose delivery and protecting bladder/rectum during EBRT. **Vaginal dilator use** is crucial post-radiation (EBRT and brachytherapy) to prevent vaginal stenosis and maintain vaginal health. Reporting any severe or worsening symptoms promptly (e.g., uncontrolled diarrhea, severe bladder pain, fever/chills, severe abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding). Maintaining good hydration and nutrition.",
    "patientResponsibilities": "Adhere rigorously to daily bowel/bladder preparation instructions before each EBRT treatment. Attend all daily EBRT sessions and scheduled brachytherapy appointments. Perform diligent skin care as instructed. Immediately post-brachytherapy, begin and consistently maintain vaginal dilator use (e.g., 3x/week for 5-10 minutes) and use vaginal moisturizers to prevent stenosis. Report all side effects promptly. Maintain good hydration and balanced diet. Attend all follow-up appointments.",
    "medicationCompliance": "Use Loperamide for diarrhea and Oxybutynin for urinary symptoms as needed. Proactive use of Esomeprazole for heartburn. Consistent use of vaginal moisturizers. Discuss any medication side effects or challenges with the care team immediately."
