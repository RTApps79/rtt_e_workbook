    "goalsDiscussed": "To deliver consolidation radiation therapy to the lymph node areas originally involved with Hodgkin Lymphoma. This treatment is intended to eradicate any remaining lymphoma cells after chemotherapy and is a critical part of the curative plan.",
    "sideEffectsReviewed": "Acute (during/shortly after RT): Fatigue is very common. GI symptoms like diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and nausea are likely due to the field location. Bladder irritation causing urinary frequency or urgency. Mild skin redness is possible. Late: The ovarian transposition surgery was performed to greatly reduce the risk of premature menopause, but some scattered radiation dose can still affect ovarian function. There is a low risk of chronic bowel/bladder changes and a very small long-term risk of a secondary cancer in the treated area.",
    "safetyConsiderations": "Maintaining a full bladder for each treatment is critical to push the small bowel out of the radiation field and reduce side effects. Following a low-residue diet (e.g., avoiding high-fiber, greasy, or spicy foods) can help manage diarrhea. Maintaining good hydration is essential. Report any uncontrolled diarrhea, significant bladder pain, or fever to the team immediately.",
