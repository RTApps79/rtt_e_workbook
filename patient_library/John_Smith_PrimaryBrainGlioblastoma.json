  "patientEducation": {
    "goalsDiscussed": "Adjuvant therapy to reduce risk of local recurrence after surgical resection of Glioblastoma. Aim to prolong progression-free and overall survival in conjunction with Temozolomide.",
    "sideEffectsReviewed": "Common: Fatigue (can be severe and prolonged), hair loss (permanent within radiation field), skin reaction (redness, dryness, peeling, moist desquamation possible in folds). Less Common/Serious: Nausea/vomiting (managed with medication), lowered blood counts (myelosuppression, increasing infection risk), brain swelling (managed with steroids), seizures (Levetiracetam prophylaxis discussed), neurocognitive changes (memory, processing, attention - can be subtle and progressive), hearing loss/vision changes (rare due to conformal planning). Very Rare: Secondary malignancy, radiation necrosis, brain hemorrhage.",
    "safetyConsiderations": "Critical: Strict adherence to daily radiation schedule and Temozolomide intake. Importance of proper positioning for daily treatment for accuracy. Rigorous skin care (gentle washing, approved moisturizers, avoid sun exposure, harsh chemicals/friction). Monitoring for signs of infection (fever >100.4Â°F, chills, sore throat) due to low blood counts and reporting immediately. Reporting any new or worsening neurological symptoms (e.g., increased weakness, new seizures, vision changes, significant confusion). Hydration and nutrition are vital for tolerance.",
    "patientResponsibilities": "Attend all daily RT appointments. Take all prescribed oral medications (Temozolomide, anti-emetics, Levetiracetam, Dexamethasone) as instructed. Perform skin care as instructed by therapists/nurses. Maintain good nutrition and hydration. Attend weekly On-Treatment Visits (OTVs) with physician and nurses, and complete all scheduled lab draws. Report any new or worsening symptoms promptly. Avoid driving if experiencing significant fatigue or confusion.",
    "medicationCompliance": "Take Temozolomide on an empty stomach, usually in the evening to minimize morning nausea. Adhere precisely to Dexamethasone taper schedule to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Continue Levetiracetam consistently to maintain seizure control. Utilize Ondansetron/Prochlorperazine proactively for nausea as needed. Discuss any medication side effects with the care team promptly."
