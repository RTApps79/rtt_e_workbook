    "goalsDiscussed": "Definitive treatment with curative intent for early-stage medically inoperable NSCLC (RUL) using Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). Goal is to achieve local tumor eradication with a highly conformal, ablative dose in a few fractions, preserving surrounding healthy lung tissue.",
    "sideEffectsReviewed": "Acute (during/immediately after treatment): Mild fatigue, occasional mild cough. Delayed (weeks to months post-treatment): Radiation pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung, causing cough, shortness of breath, fever - typically 2-6 months post-RT), chest wall soreness/pain (can occur months later due to rib irritation or fracture - rare), skin irritation/redness (less common with SBRT due to fewer fractions), esophagitis (rare for RUL, but possible if near esophagus). Long-term: Lung fibrosis (scarring), chronic cough, potential for recurrence (local or distant).",
    "safetyConsiderations": "Critical: **Precision setup and minimal patient motion** during treatment are paramount for effective SBRT. Immediate reporting of any new or worsening symptoms, especially concerning fever (>100.4°F), chills, significant increase in cough or shortness of breath, or new/severe chest pain. Maintenance of excellent general health, nutrition, and hydration. Continued abstinence from smoking is vital to maximize lung health.",
    "patientResponsibilities": "Attend all 3 SBRT treatment appointments. Maintain stillness during treatment. Report any discomfort during setup. Actively monitor and report any new or worsening symptoms post-treatment, especially respiratory changes. Continue to abstain from smoking. Attend all follow-up appointments and undergo prescribed imaging.",
    "medicationCompliance": "Use PRN Albuterol inhaler as needed for SOB. Proactive discussion of Tessalon Perles for cough and Esomeprazole for potential esophagitis. Understand that steroids may be prescribed if pneumonitis develops (patient to be educated on steroid use)."
