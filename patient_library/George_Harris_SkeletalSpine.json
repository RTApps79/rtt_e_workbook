    "goalsDiscussed": "Palliative treatment to relieve pain in the lower back, improve mobility, and prevent a potential fracture or spinal cord compression from the L3 metastasis. This will improve quality of life.",
    "sideEffectsReviewed": "Potential for a temporary 'pain flare' (worsening pain) in the first few days of RT before improving. Mild fatigue (from RT and concurrent ADT). Low risk of nausea, skin reaction (erythema, dry skin), or esophagitis (rare for lumbar spine). Patient should report any new or worsening weakness, numbness, or loss of bowel/bladder control immediately as this could indicate cord compression progression.",
    "safetyConsiderations": "Importance of attending all daily RT appointments for consistent dose delivery. Reporting any new or worsening neurological symptoms immediately. Adherence to prescribed pain medications to maintain comfort. Maintenance of hydration and nutrition. Long-term monitoring for new bony metastases.",
    "patientResponsibilities": "Attend daily RT appointments. Report pain levels and any new symptoms (especially neurological changes). Continue ADT as prescribed. Take pain medication and Dexamethasone as directed, discussing any tapering with your oncology team. Maintain gentle activity as tolerated.",
    "medicationCompliance": "Continue pain medication as prescribed and discuss tapering with primary oncology team as pain improves. Adhere to Dexamethasone taper schedule. Continue ADT as prescribed."
