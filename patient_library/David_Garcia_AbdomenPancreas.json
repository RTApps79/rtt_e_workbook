  "patientEducation": {
    "goalsDiscussed": "Neoadjuvant chemoradiation aims to shrink the pancreatic tumor and involved lymph nodes, potentially making surgery (Whipple procedure) more feasible and increasing the chance of clear surgical margins. This is a crucial step towards curative intent. Radiation (IMRT) targets the tumor precisely, and concurrent oral chemotherapy (Capecitabine) enhances radiation effectiveness.",
    "sideEffectsReviewed": "Common: Fatigue (can range from mild to moderate, especially mid-course), gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain/cramping, heartburn, appetite changes), skin irritation (erythema, dry desquamation in treatment field, less common with IMRT but still possible), myelosuppression (low blood counts, less common with Capecitabine than IV chemo, but monitored). Specific to Capecitabine: Hand-foot syndrome (redness, tenderness, peeling on palms/soles). Specific to RT: Radiation enteritis (inflammation of small bowel/colon), gastritis (stomach inflammation), liver/kidney changes (minimized with careful planning). Diabetes management may require adjustments.",
    "safetyConsiderations": "Critical: **Consistent daily positioning** on the treatment table is vital, including proper immobilization and maintaining a consistent bladder fill for daily CBCT imaging. This ensures accurate dose delivery and organ sparing. Reporting any new or worsening symptoms promptly, especially fever (>100.4°F), severe abdominal pain, persistent nausea/vomiting, significant diarrhea, or any bleeding. Careful monitoring of blood glucose levels due to diabetes. Adherence to prescribed medications for symptom management is key.",
    "patientResponsibilities": "Attend all daily RT appointments. Take oral Capecitabine exactly as prescribed (with food). Maintain consistent bladder fullness before each daily treatment. Perform daily skin care as instructed. Report all symptoms promptly (especially GI issues, hand-foot changes, fatigue). Maintain good hydration and nutrition (frequent small meals, nutritional supplements if needed). Continue monitoring blood glucose levels and adjusting diabetes medications with your endocrinologist/PCP as advised.",
    "medicationCompliance": "Reinforced importance of taking Capecitabine exactly as prescribed (timing with meals). Proactive use of anti-nausea and anti-diarrhea medications. Regular use of pancreatic enzymes with all meals/snacks. Consistent use of antacids/PPI for heartburn. Discuss any medication side effects or challenges with the care team immediately."
