  "patientEducation": {
    "goalsDiscussed": "Adjuvant radiation to the left breast and regional lymph nodes (supraclavicular and axillary levels) to reduce the risk of local and regional recurrence after surgery and chemotherapy for HER2-positive breast cancer. The boost phase delivers an additional, higher dose directly to the lumpectomy cavity, which is the area of highest recurrence risk. This comprehensive approach aims to maximize disease control and improve long-term outcomes.",
    "sideEffectsReviewed": "Acute (during RT): Skin reaction (dermatitis) in breast, axilla, and lower neck (supraclavicular fossa), progressing from redness/pinkness to dryness, peeling, and potential moist areas in skin folds (e.g., inframammary, axilla). Fatigue (common, can be significant). Potential mild esophagitis (sore throat, difficulty swallowing). Nausea (less common with RT only). Late (months-years post-RT): Lymphedema risk (arm/hand swelling) due to ALND and nodal radiation; breast texture changes (firmness, tenderness), slight size change, skin darkening. Low risk of cardiac effects (pericarditis, cardiac dysfunction) due to left-sided treatment; low risk of radiation pneumonitis (lung inflammation, cough, SOB). Very low risk of brachial plexus injury (arm/hand numbness/weakness) or rib fracture. Patient informed that these are risks, but modern techniques minimize them significantly.",
    "safetyConsiderations": "Crucial: **Lymphedema precautions are lifelong** (avoid blood pressure cuffs, needle sticks, tight jewelry on left arm; protect arm from injury/infection). Strict **skin care** (gentle washing with mild soap, applying prescribed topical creams/ointments liberally, avoiding harsh products, perfumes, deodorants, and excessive sun exposure). Reporting **any arm/hand swelling** immediately. Reporting significant skin breakdown, severe pain, worsening cough/SOB, or fever/chills (signs of infection) promptly. Maintaining good hydration and nutrition. Continue HER2-targeted therapy infusions as scheduled.",
    "patientResponsibilities": "Attend all daily RT appointments (Monday-Friday for ~6 weeks). Perform diligent skin care as instructed. Monitor for and report any signs of lymphedema. Continue all prescribed systemic medications (HER2-targeted therapy). Maintain good arm/shoulder range of motion with gentle exercises. Attend weekly On-Treatment Visits (OTVs) with physician and nurses. Report any new or worsening symptoms, especially arm swelling, significant skin reaction, or breast/axillary pain. Engage in light activity as tolerated.",
    "medicationCompliance": "Continue Trastuzumab/Pertuzumab (HP) infusions as scheduled (every 3 weeks) throughout RT course and for total planned duration (1 year). Use prescribed topical creams (Mometasone, Aquaphor) as directed for skin reaction. Take Acetaminophen PRN for discomfort. Discuss any challenges with medication adherence or side effects with the care team promptly. Understand that managing lymphedema risk is an ongoing process."
