    "sideEffectsReviewed": "Fatigue (common and can be prolonged), hair loss (scalp and spinal field, potentially permanent in some areas), skin redness/dryness/peeling (dermatitis), nausea/vomiting (especially early in treatment), lowered blood counts (myelosuppression), potential long-term neurocognitive effects (memory, processing speed, attention), hearing loss (very low risk with proton therapy or careful photon planning), growth/endocrine issues (long-term monitoring needed), secondary malignancy (very low risk).",
    "safetyConsiderations": "Importance of proper positioning for daily treatment for accuracy. Strict skin care along radiation fields (gentle washing, approved moisturizers, avoid sun exposure, harsh chemicals/friction). Monitoring for signs of infection (fever, chills, sore throat) due to low blood counts and reporting immediately. Reporting any new or worsening neurological symptoms (e.g., vision changes, weakness, balance issues). Discussion of sedation: while not currently used, it was discussed as an option to ensure patient stillness and treatment accuracy given the complexity of craniospinal fields, and will be re-evaluated if needed.",
    "patientResponsibilities": "Attend daily RT appointments without missing fractions if possible. Perform skin care as instructed by therapists/nurses. Maintain good nutrition and hydration. Attend weekly OTVs with physician and nurses, and complete all scheduled lab draws. Report any new or worsening symptoms promptly.",
    "medicationCompliance": "Adhere to Dexamethasone tapering schedule to minimize steroid side effects. Take Ondansetron/Prochlorperazine proactively for nausea as needed."
