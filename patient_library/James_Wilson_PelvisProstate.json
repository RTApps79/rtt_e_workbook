  "patientEducation": {
    "goalsDiscussed": "Definitive (curative) treatment for localized high-risk prostate cancer. The high dose of radiation to the prostate gland and seminal vesicles combined with long-course Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) aims to maximize local tumor control and improve long-term survival outcomes. ADT helps to sensitize the prostate cancer cells to radiation and treats any potential microscopic distant disease.",
    "sideEffectsReviewed": "Acute (during RT): Increased urinary frequency/urgency, potentially painful urination (dysuria), bladder spasms. Rectal discomfort, increased bowel frequency/diarrhea, tenesmus (feeling of incomplete emptying). Fatigue (common and may worsen towards end of treatment). Skin irritation (redness, dryness, itching) in groin/perineum. ADT side effects: hot flashes, fatigue, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, potential for mood changes, breast tenderness/enlargement. Late (months-years post-RT): Chronic rectal bleeding (radiation proctitis), chronic urinary urgency/frequency/incontinence, erectile dysfunction (ED), secondary cancers (very rare), bone density loss (due to ADT - managed with supplements).",
    "safetyConsiderations": "Crucial: **Daily strict adherence to bowel/bladder preparation protocol** (full bladder, empty rectum) is paramount for ensuring prostate position is consistent and for protecting bladder and rectum from high radiation doses. Use of **implanted fiducial markers for daily image guidance (IGRT)** is critical for precise targeting and minimizing dose to healthy tissue. Report any severe or worsening symptoms promptly (e.g., fever, severe pain, inability to urinate, significant rectal bleeding, uncontrolled diarrhea or vomiting). Avoid sun exposure to treated skin.",
    "patientResponsibilities": "Adhere rigorously to daily bowel/bladder preparation instructions before each treatment. Attend all daily RT sessions. Continue ADT injections as prescribed by Urology. Report all side effects promptly to the radiation oncology team (nurses/therapists/physician). Maintain excellent hydration and a balanced diet (low fiber if diarrhea is an issue). Engage in light exercise as tolerated to combat fatigue. Participate in Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy after RT if recommended.",
    "medicationCompliance": "Continue Tamsulosin as prescribed for urinary flow. Proactively use Loperamide for diarrhea and Oxybutynin for urinary symptoms as needed. Adhere to calcium/Vitamin D supplementation. Emphasize importance of ADT compliance for treatment efficacy (even if side effects are bothersome). Review any interactions with OTC medications/supplements. Provided contact numbers for nurse/physician for urgent concerns."
